What is your character's Backstory? (150 words min) 

Name of my character is AJ Lopez. He used to live with his family near San Francisco He was a brilliant child but his financial condition was not good at all, he always wanted to study and his dad worked hard everyday to pay for his fees. His dad took loans from many people for years just so that his son can complete his studies. Years went by AJ was now in college, now also his financial condition was not good, no one was trusting his father also to give him loan. Out of stress AJ`s father decided to take loan from a dangerous gangster named as Narcotics gang. His dad knew that if he doesn`t pay the gang`s loan on time his life and as well as his families lives could also be in danger. After 4 years AJ completed all his studies and went to look for a job. Even after 6 months for looking for a job we was not able to find one. Then he decided to move to Los Santos because now the gang was asking for money took my his dad. AJ found a job in Los Santos and after 1.5 years only AJ went back to San Francisco to pay off all the loans. AJ was a successful business man now but he wanted to remove all the gangster from the cities that`s why now he wants to join PD

What experience do you have which will be useful to the department? (75 words min)  

I have already played as a COP for more than 6 months and know the basic functioning of the department.. I also know the radio codes pretty well. I can handle any situation very easily. I am also good at PD RP. I am very humble and loyal towards whatever I do and when it comes to PD RP then I am gonna give my 100%.

If selected, what changes would you like to see in the department? (50 words min) 

If I get selected in the department I would like to see the officers to follow more traffic rules and formations. I would also like to remove the corrupted and inactive players from the PD. I also want to see the PD to show little leniency towards the rebels soo that when they get caught rebels get the equal chance to escape in this way rebels can enjoy the RP too.

Why should we prefer you over other people who have applied? (50 words min) 

You should prefer me over other people who have applied because as I already told that i was a part of pd which can be a valuable trait. I literally know each and every rule of the server as well as the PD sop`s. I am also gonna give my best then it doesn`t matter what so ever the situation is.

I was in PD that`s why I have very good communication and negotiation skills which I believe can be a valuable trait for PD. I also know all the types of formation

I often see some PD officers have tease fight which is obviously against the PD sop`s but still some of them are doing it for fun. In my opinion If a civilian or another PD officer sees these type of tease fights in PD they should directly report it to the higher management and the management should remove and blacklist such kind of officers from PD without any prior notice I just want to create more discipline in PD

I can handle any situation very easily as I have good communication and negotiation skills. I can also manage PD very well if I get a chance too in future. I also lead SWAT team for a few weeks in which me and my team executed some successful missions against the rebels . Now I just need a chance to prove myself once again
