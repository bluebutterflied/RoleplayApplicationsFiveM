My name is Ibrahim ........
I didn’t really have an amazing or a wonderful life, in my childhood I didn’t have a safe place to live or anybody for my safety as a kid since I belonged to a poor family. I would have a lot of robberies around my village. The police would come through to arrest the thieves, as a young boy i used look at the policemen, i had a desire to become one of them. To become a part of them, i had to learn how to fight and survive. I saw how they were living a good life and were helping remove all the criminals. This wish of mine as a young boy became a dream , I started to notice All the basic things , and how they worked so hard for everyone . Fast forward to a Few years , A big amount of Robbers Entered Our Village and Were planning to do a robbery which consisted of Innocent lives at risk , The police weren't even aware of the big robbery i rushed to the police department , to inform them . The police quickly came following me , and when they reached the robbers were just planning they quickly arrested the robbers and took them to the police department for further investigation . My confidence level boosted alot after this and i was so proud of myself , i finally had the courage to apply for this job , As i knew it i got selected , and worked extremely hard , with all my heart and , My promotions boosted by confidence by a 110% which LED me to work even harder , I Never Knew this day would come that i would be a policemen , But my hard work paid off even more , I got promoted to The rank where you start to lead the police department and i couldn't be happier , And could have asked for a better , And Ibrahim Lived Happily Ever After <3 .
