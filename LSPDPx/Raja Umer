What is your character's Backstory? (150 words min) 

My character belonged to a very poor family which lived in a small place of los Santos so-known as Sandy Shores as I grew up there I got to know about the rules and regulation I was forced to do work at the age of 10 but wanted to study hard to become a good citizen of the police department but due to bad economy of our place I couldn't at that time but I studied late night and now I have also done many police department training which would help me in future. My character had a very bad past so i hope that police department would help me to make my future bright

What experience do you have which will be useful to the department? (75 words min)  

According to pd a person should have a good sense of humor to arrest criminals and also have good aim as the situation gets worst so I am also good for that type of things but the main thing I think is that we should arrest the criminals without getting ourselves or any other person living in danger. I also have great driving skills as I have worked as a driver for a very honorable lady of the city miss saddi AKA Lauren and except that I have good driving skills which I Think would Benefit Pd A lot

If selected, what changes would you like to see in the department? (50 words min) 

If I Am giving the chance of getting selected of the honorable faction which is the police department I would do my best to make peace in the city and do my job honestly even I have to put more efforts but I will provide a great environment for the people of Los Santos so they can live without any fear of life or robbery because nowadays robberies killing someone has become of part of life so I will Do my best to Remove this thing
As Such everybody has many unique abilities that could help Police Department but it is my childhood dream to become a police officer and serve for the City
