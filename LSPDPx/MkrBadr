If selected, what changes would you like to see in the department? (50 words min) 

If i got selected in pd actually everything pd done is really great but the i thing i will change is this way of people came to pd for reports because i saw many people came to pd just for fun pd is a Serious place not their joy land i see people were dancing and laughing inside the pd and if we asked that sir whats the problem why are you here they were just for fun and i noticed people came to pd start messing around with peoples i need everyone to come to pd in queue and wait for your turns instead of crash into the conversation everything messed up when these type of people came to tyhe pd they is chair people should sit their and wait for their turns . this changes i would like to see in the department
