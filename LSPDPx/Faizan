I was born in a small town, my father was a farmer and my mother worked at homes to earn money. I grew up in a poor family, but my parents dreamed of making me successful. My father's dream was to grow up me to be a successful police officer. My parents worked hard to make this dream come true. I worked hard to fulfill this dream of my parents and went abroad to study to fulfill this dream of my parents. After going to aboard, I worked hard on my studies. And finally, after so much hard work, I got my degree.
