So basically my character Hammad belongs to a poor family he lives near a city coastline and he have been noticing it for a while that drug cartels from all over the city come to the sea side to make meth and other kind of drugs so one day he decided to report it to police but no neccessary action was taken against those drug cartels so Hammad decides to apply for police to reduce corruption and fight every possible crimes and stop drug trafficking After That When No Neccessarry Actions Were Taken Against those drug cartels he decided to leave the pd and then make an orginazations with some ex pd members the main objective of the orginazation was to operate against the gangs . This Originaztion Was Neither A Part Of Goverment nor a part of any rebel faction
