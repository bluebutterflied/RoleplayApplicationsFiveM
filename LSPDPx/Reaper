What is your character's Backstory? (150 words min) 

Hello i am Reaper i am 16 years old. I came in this city a long ago. After so many losses I came here in search of brightness but sadly i got same condition. I was so disappointed but my intention was strong so i tried in many jobs and applied everywhere but did not got any job. Then i went for the private job of garbage collector for my family and for my hunger. When i started that job everyone started hating me because of picking up garbages but i did not quit because my thought is that there is no comparison between any job. After a while i thought that i can work as a police officer and catch criminals because since my childhood my dream was to become a police officer and catch criminals.
