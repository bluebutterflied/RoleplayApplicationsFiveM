I Will Like To See The Changes In Officer Like In Every Police Department There Are People Who Do Corruption And Support illegal Work And Probably There Are People In This Department Also Who Do Their Work On The Bases Of Bribe If That Would Stop So It Will A Great Achievement For You As Well As For Me And For The City Too.

1) I THINK DECISION MAKING AT THE SITUATIONS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT AND TURNING POINT OF THE SITUATION AND I THINK I AM GOOD AT QUICK DECISION MAKING THAT HELP THE POLICE TO CAUGHT THE CRIMINAL AND COORDINATION AMONG OFFICER IS ALSO IMPORTANT TBH I DONT HAVE EXPERIENCE IN PD IF I FOUND ANY COORDINATION PROBLEM i WILL TRY TO RESOLVE BY MYSELF AND WILL TRY MY BEST TO PD.

2) IF I SELECTED I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE OFFICERS TO MAINTAIN THEIR DUTY , I HAVE EXPRIENCE THAT IF 2 PERSON DOING SAME THING LIKE WRONG PARKING OFFICER DOING DISTINGUSH BETWEEN THEM THE PERSON WHO BELONG TO ANY GROUP OR GANG POLICE WILL FINE HIM AND THE PERSON WHO IS CITIZEN OFFICER WILL NOT LOOK TOWARDS HIM,RULES ARE RULES OFFICERS HAVE TO FOLLOW THEM AND ITS EQUALLY FOR EVERYONE NOT FOR THE SPECIFIC PERSON,I KNOW ALL OFFICERS ARE NOT EQUAL BUT SOME OF THEM ARE DOING THIS AND I EXPRIENCE THAT.
