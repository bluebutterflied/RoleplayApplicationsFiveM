I Have been doing roleplay for 3 years so I know how to interact with Peoples in Role Play, I think I have the capabilities a LAW Officer must Need and I can perform my job as a LAW Officer very professionally, I do also possess Leadership consistency, since I have always been a gang leader, I can handle all sorts of players and any number, so I know how to manage mass amounts of people, So I am one of this server's most senior players, I was the Thugs and yakuza gang leader so I know how to tackle with rebels

If selected, what changes would you like to see in the department? (50 words min) 

As I have played fivem with rebel and lspd roles, I have learned a lot of skills to tackle a scenario and fast thinking to regulate a situation, I have played a game 2500+ hours minimum, I have mainly spent my day playing fivem everyday. I have learnt a lot of things by playing fivem with both rebel and lspd characters.
the thing most concerned about poor residents is robbers, I'm going to try to apprehend all the criminals and robbers in the city who rob all poor, middle class or wealthy people, I'm going to try to reduce the city's crime rate.
